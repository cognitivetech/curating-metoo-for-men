### National Organization for Men Against Sexism

* [Pro-feminist, LGBTQ+ affirmative, anti-racist, enhancing men's lives.](https://nomas.org/)
  > The National Organization for Men Against Sexism is an activist organization of men and women supporting positive changes for men. NOMAS advocates a perspective that is pro-feminist, gay affirmative, anti-racist, dedicated to enhancing men’s lives, and committed to justice on a broad range of social issues including class, age, religion, and physical abilities. We affirm that working to make this nation’s ideals of equality substantive is the finest expression of what it means to be men.
* [Teaching Positive Masculinity - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/becoming-men-teaching-positive-masculinity/361739/)
  > As gender studies gained credibility as an academic discipline around the same time, some scholars of feminist theory began to develop a new focus, known as masculinity studies. Dr. Ronald Levant played a significant role in the development of masculinity ideology, something he defines as "an individual's internalization of cultural belief systems and attitudes toward masculinity and men's roles."

  > In the Gender Role Strain Paradigm, the acquisition of gender roles is thought not to be an invariant process leading to the development of clusters of sex-typed personality traits that reside in individuals (as was thought in the older, personality trait-oriented, Gender Role Identity Paradigm; Pleck 1981,1995), but rather is conceptualized as a variable process, strongly influenced by prevailing gender ideologies, which themselves vary according to social location and cultural context. The prevailing ideologies serve to uphold extant gender-based power structures, which, for the most part, are patriarchal, mitigated to varying degrees in different societies by the differential influence of feminism, and influence how teachers, parents, and peers socialize children, and how adults think, feel, and behave (Levant, 1996a; Pleck et al., 1994).
* [The male role: An investigation of contemporary norms. - PsycNET](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-00044-001)
  > Reports on the development of the Male Role Norms Inventory (MRNI), which consists of 58 items grouped into 7 subscales: Avoidance of Femininity, Homophobia, Self-Reliance, Aggression, Achievement/Status, Attitudes Toward Sex, and Restrictive Emotionality. The MRNI was administered to 287 Ss (mostly undergraduate students). Data analysis included an assessment of internal consistency, confirmatory factor analysis, and analyses of variations in responses by sex, marital status, and age. Results indicate that the MRNI consists of 3 factors: Factor 1, consisting of 5 subscales, is relatively homogeneous and seems to tap aspects of male role norms that are currently changing; Factors 2 and 3, consisting of the Self-Reliance and Aggression subscales, respectively, seem to tap aspects of male role norms that remain stable.

  * [Let’s Rethink the Term Toxic Masculinity — A Call To Men](https://www.acalltomen.org/a-call-to-men-blog/toxicmasculinity)
    > We men have work to do. All men are socialized to view women as objects, the property of men, and of less value than men. These ideas are taught to men – sometimes unconsciously – and reinforced by society. From “you throw like a girl,” to the discrepancy in wages, to media and advertising, our culture reinforces a norm of male dominance all day, every day, and everywhere you look.
    > 
    > That collective socialization lays the foundation for all forms of violence and discrimination against women to persist because ALL men are socialized to share those values – not just the ones we deem to exhibit a toxic form of masculinity.

  > In the interview, Merriman asks, honestly, “What does the possibility of redemption look like? Is it possible? I don’t know the answer to that, and I don’t think anyone does.” She’s right. I don’t know the answer to that either; not everyone believes these men deserve to be banished from polite society for life. But if I learned anything from the Quakers, it’s that redemption isn’t possible without effort from the offender. Redemption isn’t something that happens to you when enough time has passed and enough people take pity on your financial losses. Redemption isn’t something you get by hiring someone better than you. Redemption is something you earn.

* [Consent and Treating People Decently 101: A Pop Culture Syllabus - GQ](https://www.gq.com/story/consent-pop-culture-syllabus)
  > ***Sleeping with Other People*:** In this rom-com, Alison Brie and Jason Sudeikis play two people who, after losing their virginities to each other in college, reconnect and attempt to be friends without benefits. Rom-com wisdom insists that’s not possible, but this movie takes their relationship seriously, whatever it is. When they’re friends, it doesn’t tell the audience that they’re lying to themselves. When they feel complicated, it lets them feel complicated without suggesting that the solution is sex. And, most importantly, no one gets angry at the other for not wanting something. This is not a movie about a man haranguing a woman until she agrees to be with him, it’s a movie about two friends who come to realize what and whom they want.
  > 
  > **Magic Mike XXL** This stripper road trip shows what a movie looks like for the female gaze. It’s a fantasy, for sure—a bunch of buff guys road-tripping to a stripping convention, attempting to bring joy and pleasure to every woman they see. But what’s beautiful is how seriously these men take their jobs. They are just trying to make women happy, whether it’s through dance or conversation, and they do so without the hope that it’ll lead to a hookup. That’s not to say they’re not sexually attracted to these women, but that attraction doesn’t drive their actions. Kindness does.
  > 
  > **Call Me by Your Name**  "the film is full of gentle steps taken to check if the other is on the same page. And when they finally meet at midnight to hook up, Oliver is full of questions: “Can I kiss you?,” “Are you okay?,” “Does this make you happy?” They have consented to each other in little, non-verbal ways all through the movie, but these questions make it abundantly clear they both want this, while also keeping things incredibly hot.
  > 
  > **Steven Universe** In the world of Steven Universe, the “Gems” can fuse with one another, creating bigger, more powerful creatures that combine strengths. Though for a child watching, two people dancing and becoming one could be *interpreted* as *something innocent*, many adults have picked up on the sexual undertones. In one episode, Steven discovers he can fuse with his non-Gem friend, Connie, creating “Stevonnie.” And though they have fun being in this new body together, at times it feels awkward and they’re constantly checking in with each other to see if it’s too weird to keep going. Anyone who’s had awkward sex can relate.
  > 
  > **Flight of the Conchords, “A Kiss Is Not a Contract"** This song is a reminder that not only does consent to one activity not mean consenting to all, but consent is for everyone to give and retract, not just women. Before Brent sings this, he’s making out with a woman who is pressuring him to do more, which he just doesn’t want. And while the title itself is a full lesson, the song preaches consent with humor, reminding us that “Just because you've been exploring my mouth / Doesn't mean you get to take an expedition further south, no.”

  > **[I Was a Men’s Rights Activist](https://melmagazine.com/i-was-a-men-s-rights-activist-55a0d2eb6052)** It’s important to know that people are capable of change. Much of our messaging around “Bad Men” feels hopeless, as if there’s no way forward. But this account, published on MEL Magazine, proves not only that the patriarchy hurts people of all genders, but that men can learn and grow from their mistakes.
  > 
  > **Y: The Last Man** This comic, created by Brian K. Vaughn and Pia Guerra, imagines a future in which every creature with a Y chromosome has been killed by a mysterious plague, except for Yorick and his pet monkey. Not only does Yorick manage to be the only cis man on Earth and not rape anyone (low bar, I know), the comic explores themes of feminism and gender, and depicts women as smart, cool, messy *people*, each with her own issues and motivations. Maybe it takes Yorick's being the only man alive for him to figure out women are people, but readers can get it under less extreme circumstances.
  > 
  > **Ursula K. Le Guin’s *The Dispossessed*** Much of Le Guin’s work is concerned with gender dynamics, both as they exist in our reality and how they could exist in others. *The Dispossessed* takes place in a utopia in which there is no societal difference between men and women, and where Earth’s sexual taboos don’t exist. With no patriarchy in place, relationships, sex, and friendship work in completely different ways. It’s by no means perfect, but it challenges everything we’re taught is inherent about human relationships.

  > If you decide to approach a woman in a non-horny setting—e.g., at the gas station, at the scene of an accident you just caused, or at a café where she’s reading quietly by herself—then you need to be *extra* careful to read the situation. Again, these places might seem ripe for meet-cutes in movies (the juxtaposition of romantic moment and unromantic location!), but in the real world they’re places where women are usually alone. This dynamic probably makes you, the approacher, feel less threatened, but it makes her, the approached, feel like she’s in the kitchen in *Jurassic Park* with velociraptors scraping at the door handles. If she keeps going about her business even as you try to approach her, that’s a great sign that (surprise!) she is not interested. Let her carry on with her day. Likewise, if she’s giving you short, one-word answers and doesn’t ask you any questions about yourself, that’s also a pretty good sign that she’s not interested.

## History

* [Me Too movement - Wikipedia - Timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement)
  * **2006 (Tarana Burke)**
    > Tarana Burke, a social activist and community organizer, began using the phrase "Me Too" in 2006, on the Myspace social network to promote "empowerment through empathy" among women of color who have been sexually abused. Burke, who is creating a documentary titled Me Too, has said she was inspired to use the phrase after being unable to respond to a 13-year-old girl who confided to her that she had been sexually assaulted. Burke said she later wished she had simply told the girl: "Me too".
    > 
  * **2015 (Ambra Gutierrez)**
    > In 2015 The New York Times reported that Weinstein was questioned by police "after a 22-year-old woman accused him of touching her inappropriately." The woman, Italian model Ambra Gutierrez, cooperated with the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to obtain an audio recording where Weinstein admitted to having inappropriately touched her. As the police investigation progressed and became public, tabloids published negative stories about Gutierrez that portrayed her as an opportunist. American Media, publisher of the National Enquirer, allegedly agreed to help suppress the allegations by Gutierrez and Rose McGowan. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. decided not to file charges against Weinstein, citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent, against the advice of local police who considered the evidence sufficient. The New York district attorney's office and the NYPD blamed each other for failing to bring charges.
  * **2016: Russia and Ukraine (Anastasia Melnichenko)**
    > In July 2016, a social media post by Ukrainian journalist Anastasia Melnichenko went viral. Thousands of women, and some men, in Russia and Ukraine began posting their personal stories of sexual harassment and assault on social media using the hashtag #IAmNotAfraidToSpeak (#яНеБоюсьСказати‬ in Ukrainian; #яНеБоюсьСказать in Russian). Her original post in Ukrainian[92] was about a sexual harassment in family, on the streets, with ex-boyfriend, but not in the workspace. 
  * **2017 (Alyssa Milano)**
    > Alyssa Milano encouraged use of the hashtag after accusations against Harvey Weinstein surfaced in 2017.
    >
    > Following widespread exposure of accusations of predatory behavior by Harvey Weinstein, and her own blog post on the subject, on October 15, 2017, actress Alyssa Milano wrote: "If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet.", and reposted the following phrase suggested by a friend: "If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote ‘Me too.’ as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem."

* [Addressing Gender Socialization and Masculinity Norms Among Adolescent Boys: Policy and Programmatic Implications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5817048/)
  > What Are the Key Masculinity Norms Endorsed in Early Adolescence?
  > As highlighted in the review [15], young adolescents endorse masculinity norms related to: physical toughness (e.g., showing higher tolerance for pain, engaging in fights, competing in sports); autonomy (e.g., being financially independent, protecting and providing for families); emotional stoicism (e.g., not acting like girls or showing vulnerabilities, dealing with problems on one's own); and heterosexual prowess (e.g., having sex with many girls, exercising control over girls in relationships; For more details about the themes, see the review [15]).
* [The Man Box: A Study on Being a Young Man in the US, UK, and Mexico – Key Findings – Promundo](https://promundoglobal.org/resources/man-box-study-young-man-us-uk-mexico-key-findings/#)
  > The Man Box report, launched by Promundo and Axe, Unilever’s leading male grooming brand, is a new study on young men’s attitudes, behaviors, and understandings of manhood. The research, conducted with a representative, random sample of young men aged 18 to 30 in the US, UK, and Mexico, reveals that most men still feel pushed to live in the “Man Box” – a rigid construct of cultural ideas about male identity. This includes being self-sufficient, acting tough, looking physically attractive, sticking to rigid gender roles, being heterosexual, having sexual prowess, and using aggression to resolve conflicts.
* [Criminal Victimization, 2017 summary](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv17_sum.pdf)
  > The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) found that the number of persons age 12 or older who had been victims of violent crime during the prior six months increased from 2.7 million in 2015 to 2.9 million in 2016 (up 9% from 2015) and 3.1 million in 2017 (up 17% from 2015). Overall, the portion of persons age 12 or older who had been victims of violent crime increased from 0.98% in 2015 to 1.14% in 2017. Te rise was primarily driven by an increase in simple assault (which is generally non-felony assault). Year-to-year, there was a statistically signifcant increase in the total number of residents age 12 and over who were victimized by violent crime from 2015 to 2016, while no statistically signifcant increase was found from 2016 to 2017. 
* [2019 MeToo National Sexual Harassment and assault report](http://geh.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-metoo-national-sexual-harassment-and-assault-report.pdf)
  > This 2019 national survey reconfirms the findings of our 2018 national survey: Sexual harassment and assault are widespread problems in the United States, causing pain, limiting people’s lives, and negatively affecting communities and society. Study results show that most women and many men have experienced one or more form of harassment and assault, while a comparably smaller proportion tells us that they’ve ever committed these acts. This may indicate that many abusers are repeat offenders who abuse multiple people. The findings add to the large evidence base demonstrating that nearly all instances where someone is accused of sexual harassment are based in fact, and most respondents believe those who make high-profile accusations.

Atwater, Allison M. Tringale, Rachel E. Sturm, Scott N. Taylor, and Phillip W. Braddy (*Organizational Dynamics,* forthcoming)
  > In this paper, we review what our ongoing research has found with respect to sexual harassment in the workplace and we attempt to unravel some of the complexities surrounding attitudes men and women have about the #MeToo movement. We aim to provide recommendations on what leaders can do within their organizations to help make this time of disruption and societal turmoil one that becomes generative. We conclude our paper with a cautionary note to organizational leaders that planting seeds of inaction or passiveness will bring a bitter harvest, while choosing to act now can create more inclusive and higher performing workplaces.
  * [The #MeToo Backlash](https://hbr.org/2019/09/the-metoo-backlash)
    > Because the data was collected soon after the #MeToo movement gained momentum, and because much of it focused on expectations, the researchers conducted a follow-up survey (with different people) in early 2019. This revealed a bigger backlash than respondents had anticipated. For instance, 19% of men said they were reluctant to hire attractive women, 21% said they were reluctant to hire women for jobs involving close interpersonal interactions with men (jobs involving travel, say), and 27% said they avoided one-on-one meetings with female colleagues; only one of those numbers was lower in 2019 than the numbers projected the year before. The researchers say that some of the behaviors are manifestations of what is sometimes called the Mike Pence rule—a reference to the U.S. vice president’s refusal to dine with female colleagues unless his wife is present. “I’m not sure we were surprised by the numbers, but we were disappointed,” says Rachel Sturm, a professor at Wright State University who worked on the project. “When men say, ‘I’m not going to hire you, I’m not going to send you traveling, I’m going to exclude you from outings’—those are steps backward.”
    > 
    > In 2015 the Canadian Armed Forces launched Operation HONOUR, aimed at preventing sexual misconduct and assault among military personnel. As part of that effort Denise Preston, a psychologist who has worked with victims and imprisoned sex offenders, was hired in 2017 as the executive director of the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre, which operates outside the military chain of command to support victims of sexual misconduct and lead prevention efforts. She spoke with HBR about the center’s work. Edited excerpts follow.

After that self-reflection, start living by the principles of healthy, respectful manhood, and valuing women, girls and those of us who do not conform to a gender binary. We know that if we can get men to embrace and promote a healthy, respectful manhood, we will prevent violence and discrimination against women, sexual assault, sexual harassment, bullying and many other social ills. Men will also be healthier, whole and authentic men. Finally, all men can use their influence and platform to speak out about these issues. Some men don’t even realize they have a platform, but they all do. All men have friends, colleagues, family members, and young men and boys in their lives that they can talk to about healthy, respectful manhood.

  > The #MeToo movement is about basic human rights. The right not to be touched without consent. The right not to be coerced. The right to be left alone. Our laws limit the power of the government and other private citizens to touch us or follow us around or force us to do something we don’t want to do, but a different standard often applies when women complain about men’s unwanted behavior. That conduct is often accepted as “the way of the world” or “how men and women interact.” A woman reporting harassment is told she is being too sensitive.
  > 
  > If we accept that men have more power than women and that women have a legitimate claim to better treatment, and if we believe in basic human rights and dignity, then men are compelled to speak up and join the #MeToo movement—not as men advocating for women, but as human beings advocating for better treatment of our fellow human beings.

  > Of course, as promising as all this is, it’s still only a small step in the right direction. “This is no doubt a watershed moment in empowering victims to speak up and share stories,” Sandberg argued in her Facebook post. “But it is not enough.

Meanwhile, a 2019 survey of 5,649 university students by sexual health charity Brook found that 56 per cent had encountered unwelcome sexual behaviour.

With regards to the #MeToo Movement, one component of allyship is demonstrating that you believe the experience, story, and pain without hesitation, doubt, and disbelief. Actively affirming the truth that has been shared is vital. CAPS has chosen to focus specifically on this one component because it can be both simple and very difficult for many men. At the same time, this critical first step can be transformative for survivors, our UM community, and work towards greater allyship.
* [Men and the #MeToo Movement: Examining Past Behaviors - U-M Counseling and Psychological Services](https://caps.umich.edu/article/men-and-metoo-movement-examining-past-behaviors)
  > The focus of this article is to help men examine, and ultimately change, behavior on an individual level. This process can be difficult and examining one’s own actions may cause men to feel confusion, anger, or altogether stuck. These reactions are normal when a man recognizes some of his past behaviors misalign with his values or have harmed someone, regardless of his intent. The next step, then, is not to remain stuck but to see this as an opportunity to acknowledge, address, and correct the hurt that they may have caused. While it may not be a man’s intent to make a woman feel pressured, coerced, or fearful, impact and not intent is what is important as allies in the #MeToo Movement.
